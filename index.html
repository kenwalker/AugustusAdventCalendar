				<div id="method">
					<div id="card-about">
						Long pepper was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. It's now cultivated in India and Indonesia
						and used in Asian and African cuisines. Resembling small, elongated pinecones, long pepper
						offers a flavor similar to black pepper, but with an earthy undertone and a slightly numbing
						finish. You can use it in place of black pepper in any recipe. You'll need a spice grinder or
						mill for ground use or spice blends, but for stews or slow-cooked dishes, you can simply add a
						few whole peppers to the pot and remove them before serving.<br><br>
						Augustus has used this in many recipes served at feasts and also finely ground, as a topping like pepper, for
						people to add as they see fit.

						<li>After they’ve soaked, remove the peels from the fava beans (or buy pre-peeled beans).</li>
						<li>In a large pot, stir together the olive oil and onions so that the onions are coated in the oil. Set it over medium heat and cook for 5 minutes or until the onions are translucent.</li>
						<li>Add the water to the pot and bring it to a boil. Be careful because the water and oil might spatter.</li>
						<li>When the water is boiling, add the barley. Cover and cook for 30 minutes. If you're using pearl barley, cook it for 15 minutes.</li>
						<li>Stir in the fava beans, garlic, vinegar, and salt. Simmer uncovered for about 30 minutes, or until it becomes a thick porridge.</li>

						Garum is an ancient Roman condiment made by fermenting fish. It was made using
						whole fish, or parts of fish, and mixing with herbs and lots of salt. It took months
						to ferment this down, sitting in the sun, then strained to get the liquid garum. It is
						a savoury, salty condiment and the modern Asian fish sauces are very similar in taste.<br><br>
						In the photo you can see an Italian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colatura_di_alici" target="_blank">Colatura di alici</a> and a typical Asian

						Nutmeg, and the ground spice we use, is a tree seed/pit. What's often not known is another common spice, Mace,
						is produced from the seed covering. The history of nutmeg is quite tragic in the wars waged over 
						its production (See <a href="https://www.myspicer.com/history-of-nutmeg/" target="_blank">MySpicer.com history</a>). Freshly
						grated nutmeg has an amazing blend of aromas from sweet and spicy, to woody/nutty.<br><br>

						A mix of pepper, ginger, and cardomom flavours, this small brown seed was seen as

					<div id="card-about">
						Asafoetida powder (Hing powder) is a gum-resin, a hard substance extracted from Ferula plant roots. It is a potent smelling ingredient also known
						as Devil's Dung! The smell is very sulpher like with a taste of sauteed garlic and onions. It has been used 
						through the years both medicinally and in cooking. It is well used in Indian recipes and Augustus followed
						an old Roman Pork and Apple recipe which called for this spice. Even sealed in the container, you can tell
						which cupboard that container is in!

				<div id="cinnamon-image"></div>
				<div id="method">
					<div id="card-about">
						You likely have some cinnamon in your pantry. But, which kind of cinnamon is it? In North America
						it is Cassia cinnamon that is more commonly used. Hard single layer sticks great for infusing in liquid as
						they hold the shape. The ground Cassia is coarse, bold & rich in flavour. Shown in the image
						is the Ceylon cinnamon. The sticks are like flakey layers, easy to break up or grind. The ground Ceylon
						is a finer powder and is subtle in sweetness and has a more delicate aroma. The shown cinnamon
						was brought back from Sri Lanka where the owner of the spice plantation assured me that we should
						never use Cassia cinnamon again. There are definately uses for both.
						A great write up in The Spice House article <a href="https://www.thespicehouse.com/blogs/news/ceylon-vs-cassia-cinnamon" target="_blank">"Ceylon vs. Cassia Cinnamon"</a>.

					<div id="card-about">
						Ok, lets just first say that this recipe has various versions including some that
						list using chicken in it! What I wanted was a medieval dessert, not a main! If you've
						ever had peanut brittle, this is very similar. It uses the now very expensive pine
						nuts. Augustus found a pretty good deal so included this in a feast. You can substitue other
						nuts but likely they'll need to be chopped up somewhat.
