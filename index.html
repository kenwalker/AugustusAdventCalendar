				<div id="method">
					<div id="card-about">
						Long pepper was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. It's now cultivated in India and Indonesia
						and used in Asian and African cuisines. Resembling small, elongated pinecones, long pepper
						offers a flavor similar to black pepper, but with an earthy undertone and a slightly numbing
						finish. You can use it in place of black pepper in any recipe. You'll need a spice grinder or
						mill for ground use or spice blends, but for stews or slow-cooked dishes, you can simply add a
						few whole peppers to the pot and remove them before serving.<br><br>
						Augustus has used this in many recipes served at feasts and also finely ground, as a topping like pepper, for
						people to add as they see fit.

						Garum is an ancient Roman condiment made by fermenting fish. It was made using
						whole fish, or parts of fish, and mixing with herbs and lots of salt. It took months

						a savoury, salty condiment and the modern Asian fish sauces are very similar in taste.<br><br>

						A mix of pepper, ginger, and cardomom flavours, this small brown seed was seen as

						Asafoetida powder (Hing powder) is a gum-resin, a hard substance extracted from Ferula plant roots. It is a potent smelling ingredient also known
						as Devil's Dung! The smell is very sulpher like with a taste of sauteed garlic and onions. It has been used 
						through the years both medicinally and in cooking. It is well used in Indian recipes and Augustus followed
						an old Roman Pork and Apple recipe which called for this spice. Even sealed in the container, you can tell
						which cupboard that container is in!

				<div id="cinnamon-image"></div>
				<div id="method">
					<div id="card-about">
						You likely have some cinnamon in your pantry. But, which kind of cinnamon is it? In North America
						it is Cassia cinnamon that is more commonly used. Hard single layer sticks great for infusing in liquid as
						they hold the shape. The ground Cassia is coarse, bold & rich in flavour. Shown in the image
						is the Ceylon cinnamon. The sticks are like flakey layers, easy to break up or grind. The ground Ceylon
						is a finer powder and is subtle in sweetness and has a more delicate aroma. The shown cinnamon
						was brought back from Sri Lanka where the owner of the spice plantation assured me that we should
						never use Cassia cinnamon again. There are definately uses for both.
						A great write up in The Spice House article <a href="https://www.thespicehouse.com/blogs/news/ceylon-vs-cassia-cinnamon" target="_blank">"Ceylon vs. Cassia Cinnamon"</a>.

						Ok, lets just first say that this recipe has various versions including some that

						<li>Grind the long pepper as finely as possible. Biting into a big piece of it isn’t fun.</li>
						<li>Mix the nuts and pepper until everything is evenly dispersed. Stuff the dates with the nut mixture. Pack as much of the stuffing as you can into each date, otherwise it’ll all fall out when you go to cook them. Close the date around the filling as much as possible, and continue until all the dates are filled.</li>
						<li>Put the fine sea salt in a shallow bowl or plate and roll the stuffed dates in the salt.</li>
						<li>Bring the honey to a simmer in a saucepan. Cook the honey for about 10 minutes, keeping an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t get too hot and boil over.</li>
						<li>Add the dates to the honey, cut side up so the filling doesn’t come out. Spoon or push the honey over the dates and let them cook for about 45 seconds to 1 minute.</li>

						a hungry fighter and participant at an Ironclad event. The Pork was cooked just before the event on a Big Green Egg smoker. But, this recipe shows using an oven.

						<li>Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a baking sheet with foil, then place a roasting rack on top of it.</li>
						<li>In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, salt, pepper, and honey. There should be enough to coat the pork roast. Adjust the amounts to your liking.</li>
						<li>Brush the olive oil mixture onto the pork, then roast for 15 minutes.</li>
						<li>Lower the temperature to 275°F (135°C) and cook for about an hour per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches at least 165°F (74°C). Take the roast out and let it rest for 15 minutes.</li>

						<li>Deglaze the pot with the chicken stock and garum. Toss in the cilantro and roasted pork. Add enough additional chicken stock so that it covers the bottom of the pot.</li>
						<li>Simmer for 15 minutes, adding more stock if necessary.</li>
						<li>Add the apples, then cook for another 20 minutes or until the meatballs are fully cooked.</li>
					</ol>
